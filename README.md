This repository contains my projects from Florida Atlantic University's Machine Learning course, CAP 6673. The following is a list of the projects.
1. Regression. In this project, I fit regression lines of various orders to a data set, comparing the results. I then use a logistic regression algorithm and the method of steepest descent to minimize cost and build linear and quadratic decision curves.
2. Perceptrons. The first part of this project involves the training of a single-layer perceptron that identifies images of handwritten digits. The second part involves the training of a multi-layer perceptron for the same task.
3. Support Vector Machine. This project uses a linear SVM to classify one set of data and a polynomial SVM to classify a second set of data.
4. Principal Component Analysis. In this project, I use PCA to classify images of human faces.
5. Independent Componenet Analysis. This project uses a Fast ICA to remove noise from an image of neurons.
6. Hopfield Network. In this project I build a Hopfield network containing patterns of digits and use the network to update noisy patterns of the digits.
7. Kalman Filter. This project utilizes a Kalman filter to estimate the true height of water in a tank.
8. Q and Deep Learning. This final project is a research paper on Q and Deep Q Learning. Included with the paper is code from the implementation of the algorithm.
